By this part of the project we not only have a console /command interpreter for
the Holberton Airbnb clone project, that can be used to store objects in and
retrieve objects from a JSON, but also it will has the possible to switch the
storage engine and use SQLAlchemy.

We have learned how to manage a console which classes allows us
to handle information like Users, places, states, cities and others ones by
changing the engine storage with SQLAlchemy.

### Supported classes:
* BaseModel
* User
* State
* City
* Amenity
* Place
* Review

### Commands:
* create - create an object
* show - show an object (based on id)
* destroy - destroy an object
* all - show all objects, of one type or all types
* quit/EOF - quit the console
* help - see descriptions of commands

To start, navigate to the project folder and enter `./console.py` in the shell.

#### Create
`create <class name>`
Ex:
`create BaseModel`

#### Show
`show <class name> <object id>`
Ex:
`show User my_id`

#### Destroy
`destroy <class name> <object id>`
Ex:
`destroy Place my_place_id`

#### All
`all` or `all <class name>`
Ex:
`all` or `all State`

#### Quit

#### Help

Additionally, the console supports `<class name>.<command>(<parameters>)` syntax.
